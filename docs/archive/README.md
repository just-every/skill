# Operational Playbooks

The archived docs capture infrequently updated runbooks referenced by
`PLAN.md`, AGENTS.md, and onboarding material. Keep these files current whenever
you change bootstrap flows, SSO providers, or deployment automation.

- `SSO.md` – Better Auth + login worker integration and troubleshooting.
- `DEPLOYMENTS.md` – Manual + CI deployment flows, rollback, and smoke testing.

Update or add new files here as operations evolve so downstream teams always
have a canonical reference.
